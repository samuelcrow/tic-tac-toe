### Roadmap  
It would be a lot of fun to add the following to my PacMan game  
- Scoring system for multiple games.  I would add this by using [scoreX, setScoreX] and [scoreO, setScoreO] to track the state of the score and update it every time someone wins.  So, when a win is triggered, I would update the state for whichever side won and increase it by one.  Then I would have the score displayed.  
- Different themes for tik-tac-toe.  This would be buttons in a menu that would update the CSS for everything.  I would have a button that would change the CSS file that is being used.
